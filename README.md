Project 3 -- python pandas

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a presentation about the python library called `pandas` originally written by Wes McKinney. The library can be used to analyze data that is either created or imported. Data structures specific to `pandas` include `Series` and `DataFrames`. They can be used to organize data, and using methods from the library `matplotlib`, model the data with different kinds of graphs.

[Here are our presentation slides for comedic/educational use](https://goo.gl/gXA7Yn).


## HOW TO INSTALL PANDAS 

1. Create your venv to provide a clean working space for pandas as follows.
`python3 -m venv <venv_name>`
2. Activate your venv by running `source <venv_name>/bin/activate`.
3. Your computer's name should be preceeded by `(venv_name)` now. You are inside your virtual environment.
4. You can deactivate your venv by running the command `deactivate`
5. You can activate the venv from any current working directory by running `source ~/venv_name/bin/activate`
6. Install the required dependencies to use `pandas` like this:
`pip install -r <path-to-file>requirements.txt`
